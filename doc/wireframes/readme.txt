1-home_and_5-animal-page.pdf has the drawings of two pages on the website: the top half represents the home page, when the user first visits the website (we still need to find a dataset with animal images) and the bottom half represents the generic animal page where the dataset truly 'comes to life'. Here is where all of the facts are listed and presented in a way to make it easy to learn about animals.  
2-continent-map.pdf shows how the website would look like when the user selects a continent map to look further into. It is an interactive way of looking at the data.
3-list-of-animals-in-country.pdf shows how the website would look like when a user clicks on a specific country on the map or on the list that is provided to the left of the continent map. A full list of all the animals that reside in a specific country are shown. 
4-filter-usage.pdf shows the website when the filter is used. It is a very basic type of filter. 
DISCLAIMER: WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO NAME OUR WEBSITE, SO WE ARE USING THE TITLE "WILD THANGS" AS A FILLER FOR NOW. IT IS NOT THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE WEBSITE.
